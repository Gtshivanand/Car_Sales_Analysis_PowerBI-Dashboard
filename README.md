Analyzed car sales data using Power BI, utilizing Power Query for data cleaning and transformation. Applied DAX for advanced calculations and insights. Created interactive visualizations with time intelligence functions to track sales trends and developed dynamic reports for stakeholders to explore sales by region, model, and period.

## INTRODUCTION:
The Car Sales Dashboard was developed in Power BI to provide a comprehensive overview of sales performance for a car dealership. This dynamic and interactive dashboard enables stakeholders to track key performance indicators (KPIs), identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. The project was structured into various phases, including data import, modeling, DAX formula creation, visualization, and optimization. 

## PROJECT BACKGROUND:
The project is centred around the critical analysis of a car dealership. The report evaluates the development and implementation of a Power BI Car Sales Dashboard for the same. The dashboard aims to optimize sales performance tracking and enable data-driven decision-making. 

## Business Problem:

Car dealerships need an efficient way to monitor sales performance, understand customer preferences, and optimize inventory. This dashboard addresses these needs by visualizing key metrics and providing insights into sales patterns.

##  Project Overview:

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of car sales data, offering stakeholders dynamic visualizations and key insights. The project involves data cleaning, transformation, and modeling using Power Query and DAX to enhance sales performance tracking and decision-making.

## Problem Statement:

The goal is to create a dynamic Car Sales Dashboard in Power BI that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) to track and analyze sales performance. The dashboard will focus on:

KPI Requirements:
- Sales Overview (YTD, MTD, YOY growth, PTYD comparisons)
- Average Price Analysis (YTD, MTD, YOY growth, PTYD comparisons)
- Cars Sold Metrics (YTD, MTD, YOY growth, PTYD comparisons)

Chart Requirements:
- Weekly YTD Sales Trend (line chart)
- YTD Sales by Body Style and Color (pie charts)
- YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region (map chart)
- Company-wise Sales Trend (grid)
- Detailed Sales Information Grid (table with car model, style,   color, sales data, etc.)

The dashboard will offer real-time insights to help monitor performance, identify trends, and support data-driven decision-making.

## Project Workflow:

### Data Import and Pre-processing:

1. Import sales data into Power BI (CSV, Excel).
2. Cleanse the data using Power Query: replace erroneous values (e.g., fix "Double√Ç Overhead Camshaft"), and ensure correct headers by using the first row.
3. Check column quality and distribution in Power Query for errors.

### Creating Calendar Table for Time Intelligence:

Generate a Calendar Table: CALENDAR(MIN(car_data[Date]), MAX(car_data[Date])).

Extract Year, Month, and Week from the Calendar Table for time-based analysis:

Year = YEAR('Calendar Table'[Date])

Month = FORMAT('Calendar Table'[Date], "MMMM")

Week = WEEKNUM('Calendar Table'[Date])

### Data Modeling:

Connect the Calendar Table to the car sales data via the Date column.
Use model view to establish relationships between tables.

### Calculating KPIs with DAX:

1. YTD Sales: TOTALYTD(SUM(car_data[Price ($)]), 'Calendar Table'[Date])
2. PYTD Sales: CALCULATE(SUM(car_data[Price ($)]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar Table'[Date]))
3. Sales Difference: YTD Sales - PYTD Sales
4. YOY Growth: (Sales Difference) / PYTD Sales
5. MTD Sales: TOTALMTD(SUM(car_data[Price ($)]), 'Calendar Table'[Date])
6. Average Price: SUM(car_data[Price ($)]) / COUNT(car_data[Car_id])
7. YTD Average Price: TOTALYTD([Avg Price], 'Calendar Table'[Date])
8. MTD Average Price: TOTALMTD([Avg Price], 'Calendar Table'[Date])
9. Cars Sold: COUNT(car_data[Car_id])
10. YTD Cars Sold: TOTALYTD(COUNT(car_data[Car_id]), 'Calendar Table'[Date])

Format KPIs as needed, e.g., concatenate sales info and format in millions or thousands.

###  Visualization Development:

Line Chart: YTD Sales Weekly Trend.
Pie Charts: YTD Sales by Body Style and Color.
Map Chart: Sales distribution by dealer region.
Grid Table: Company-wise sales trend and detailed car sales data.
Area Chart: Display YTD Sales Weekly Trend with max sales point.
Dashboard Design:
Arrange KPIs at the top and detailed visualizations below.
Add slicers for filtering by body style, color, region, and company.

## Key Features:

* Sales Performance Metrics: Year-to-Date (YTD), Month-to-Date (MTD), Year-over-Year (YOY) comparisons.

* Advanced DAX Calculations: Implemented time intelligence functions to analyze trends.

* Dynamic Visualizations: Sales trends by region, car model, body style, and color.
